Solution:
  subtask
  agent, that can do it (ref or criteria),
  what is needed (resources, for example)



  task ontology

# execution:
  # state keeper: agent. creates a var, representing the state
    # fix_the_world: 0.0
    sets done criteria - target state for that var: 1.0
    then runs fix_the_world subroutine.


example:
  version: '1.0'
  fix the world:
# ok, a bit simpler one...

version: '1.0'

vars.
want to change one - do it.
or make others want to do it

solution - thing to execute to make a specific variable look better
