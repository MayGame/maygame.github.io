    <p>Optimizer, problem solver, and, a plater, of course.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Link to neural networks guide</a></p>
    <p>In this game, we face problems regularly, and solving them. </p>
    <h3>There are many ways...</h3>
    <p>Usually, there is more than one solution, to your problem.</p>
<h3>Let's cooperate</h3>
<p>There's a lot of problems we have in common, and most of them can be solved by cooperating and delegating.</p>
<h3>Having fun is important</h3>
<p>Boredom... Is one of those problems we all(?) face regularly.</p>
<p>Sometimes it might be even worse (despair, ...).</p>
<p>As managing your state is really important, we can combine the two (or possibly more),</p>
<p>and do things in an efficient manner, having fun in the process.</p>
