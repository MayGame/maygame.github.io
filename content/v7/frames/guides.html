    <h2>Welcome to the Game!</h2>
    <h3>You are an optimizer</h3>
    <p>Optimizer, problem solver, and, a player, of course.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Link to neural networks guide</a></p>
    <p>In this game, we face problems regularly, and solving them. </p>
    <h3>There are many ways...</h3>
    <p>Usually, there is more than one solution to your problem.</p>
<h3>Let's cooperate</h3>
<p>There's a lot of problems we have in common, and most of them can be solved by cooperating and delegating.</p>
<h3>Some problems aren't here for you to solve em!</h3>
<p>You don't really have to do all the meaningless things just because...</p>
<h3>Automate it!</h3>
<p>If it takes too much of your time and is boring -> either you do it wrong, and there's a solution for that</p>
<p>or... You are not the only one and it can be solved for everyone to enjoy it.</p>
<h3>Don't get caught in the loop.</h3>
<p>Solving one problem might bring you to a state, where you are stuck, doing ...</p>
<p>See the paragraph about the meaningless shtuff above ^ </p>
<h3>Dont waste resources!</h3>
<p>Things from above are applicable to the other agents too. </p>
<h3>Having fun is important</h3>
<p>Boredom... Is one of those problems we all(?) face regularly.</p>
<p>Sometimes it might be even worse (despair, ...).</p>
<p>As managing your state is really important, we can combine the two (or possibly more),</p>
<p>and do things in an efficient manner, having fun in the process.</p>
